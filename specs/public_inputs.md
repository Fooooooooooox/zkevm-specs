# Necessary public Data

Some of the data defined in the previous section will be available along with
the proof when it is submitted for verification.  More data than strictly
necessary to verify a proof will be included in order to allow a node to
synchronize the State Trie.

## Data to synchronize the State Trie

In order to synchronize the State Trie after a new block (assuming we have the sate
of the previous block), we need the at least the following data:

- For each tx
    - GasPrice: 256 bits
    - Gas: 64 bits
    - CallerAddress: 160 bits
    - CalleeAddress: 160 bits
    - Value: 256 bits
    - CallData: CallDataLength bytes
- Block fields that affect EVM execution
    - Coinbase: 160 bits
    - Difficulty: 256 bits
    - Number: 64 bits
    - GasLimit: 64 bits
    - Time: 64 bits
    - BaseFee: 256 bits
- Extra fields that affect EVM execution
    - block[-1..-257].Hash
    - ChainID: 64 bits

The signature is not needed to synchronize the State Trie, and the nonce can be
inferred from the State Trie of the previous block.

## Data to calculate a new block

In order to calculate a new block (assuming we have the sate of the previous
block), we need at least the following data:

- A way to prove that block[-1].Root (calculated from the known State Trie) is
  included in block[-1..-257].Hash
    - A simple way to resolve this is by publishing the StateRoot with each
      proof (liked via public input)
    - Another way to resolve this is by publishing all block fields, so that a
      verifier can calculate the block hash in the circuit proving that it uses
      the expected StateRoot.

## Data to verify synchronization

Even though a node may have enough data to synchronize the State Trie, the node
can't verify if the computed State Trie is correct (it's the same used in the
proof).  For that it the following value should be published:

- StateRoot

# Public Input approach

The necessary public data may not be equal to the verification circuit public
inputs.  This is because every circuit public input value has a verification
cost, which should be minimized.

To minimize the circuit public inputs we introduce the idea of the PublicInputs
Circuit, which takes a compression/commitment of the necessary public data and
validates it, while setting up this necessary public data in the shape that the
rest of the circuits expect (be it as Tables for lookups or as public input
values).  The PublicInputs Circuit is verified by the top level aggregation
circuit, which is only required to have a very small amount of public inputs
(namely, the commitment of the necessary public data).

In more detail:
We have a list of raw public inputs (which includes the necessary public data)
that must reach the aggregation circuit.
We want to minimize the number of public inputs for a circuit to reduce the
verification cost, so we'd like to "compress them" somehow.
There are different possibilities for this "compression": the most advanced
ones involve new EIPs (like 4844) that "cheaply" generate commitments of data
sent to Ethereum, that can later be "uncompressed" (opened) from a contract.
We would open such a commitment inside the PublicInputs circuit, which has as
public input the small commitment.  The PublicInputs circuit proves the
equivalence of the commitment to the values used in the commitment (the raw
public inputs).

The following steps describe the process:
1. Send `raw_public_inputs` to Ethereum
2. Get `p=commitment(raw_public_inputs)`
3. Use `p` as public input for the `Aggregation0` [1] circuit
4. `Aggregation0` circuit uses `p` as public input for `public_input_circuit`
5. `public_input_circuit` verifies that `p` contains the values in an advice column (which must correspond to the `raw_public_inputs`)
6. `public_input_circuit` lays out the advice column `raw_public_inputs` into the `tx_table`, `block_table`, etc.
7. When `Aggregation0` circuit verifies `public_input_circuit` proof, it has access to commitments of advice columns corresponding to `tx_table`, `block_table`, etc.  We call these table commitments.
8. `Aggregation0` circuit passes these table commitments around (to other aggregation circuits) until they reach the circuit that uses them
9. aggregation circuit that verifies a circuit that uses a table, uses the table commitment in the verification of the proof.

As a shortcut, for 1 and 2 we do:
1. Calculate `raw_public_inputs` from the necessary public inputs passed via
   calldata in the tx where we call the zkEVM verification function
2. `p = RLC(raw_public_inputs, rand)`
    - `rand = hash(raw_public_inputs, commitment(public_input_circuit:advice_raw_public_inputs))`

Point 2 requires:
- A. `Aggregation0` must have `rand` and `commitment(public_input_circuit:advice_raw_public_inputs)` as public input
- B. `public_input_circuit` must have "rand" as public input

Notes:
- [1] `Aggregation0` circuit is the top level aggregation circuit which is verified in an L1 contract.
- With this approach, once we cross the `Aggregation0` circuit, the verification cost of each proof is independent of the "real" number of public inputs (i.e. the number of transactions, the size of call data, the number of block fields, etc.)
- Calculating an RLC of values in a contract is cheap (it just needs `MULMOD`, `ADDMOD`)

The following diagram shows the the public input approach using the RLC shortcut:

# PublicInputs Circuit

## Setup

All the necessary public data is arranged in a single array of elements (called
`raw_public_inputs`), following the layout of the `block_table` `value` column,
`tx_table` {`tx_id`, `index`, `value`} columns, and extra fields in between.

## Public Inputs

- `rand_rpi`: Randomness used to "compress" the raw public inputs
- `rpi_rlc`: Random Linear Combination of the raw public inputs (using `rand_rpi` as randomness)
- `chain_id`: Chain ID, used to match the Chain ID public input used in the Tx Circuit
- `state_root`: State Root of current block, used to match the State Root of current block public input used in the State Circuit
- `state_root_prev`: State Root of previous block, used to match the State Root of previous block public input used in the State Circuit

## Behaviour

First, the circuit calculates the Random Linear Combination of a column
containing the raw public inputs array, and verifies that the result matches
the `rpi_rlc` passed via public inputs using `rand_rpi` as randomness.

Second, the circuit proves that the contained `block_table -> value` and
`tx_table -> {tx_id, index, value}` columns correspond to the correct sections
of the raw public inputs column.

Finally, the circuit proves that the `chain_id`, `state_root` and
`state_root_prev` in the public inputs are found in the correct offset in the
raw public inputs column.

## Code

NOTE: The current code only uses the block fields (in the `raw_public_inputs`)
required by the `block_table` (used by the EVM circuit).  In the future we want
to calculate the block hash in a circuit, so we will need to extend the block
fields to match every field found in the block header.

NOTE: The Word values (256 bits) that appear in the `raw_public_inputs` are not
RLC encoded because we may use a different approach to encode Words to avoid
requiring a shared randomness among all circuits.  See
https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/zkevm-specs/issues/216
The reference code temporarily encodes Words in fields (which is insecure due
to collisions), and will be updated once we reach an agreement on issue 216.
